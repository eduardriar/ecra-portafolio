            <p>Well... As you read, I'm a <strong>web developer</strong> formed in Universidad de La Sabana in Bogot√° - Colombia where I'm currently located. I'm a big fan of building the <strong>front-end</strong> part of a web page, and also really into solving challenges from it. I'm very curious about learning new technologies and passionate from writing code that everyone can understand.</p>
